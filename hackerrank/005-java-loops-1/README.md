## Objective 

In this challenge, we're going to use loops to help us do some simple math.

## Task

Given an integer,`N` , print its first `10` multiples. Each multiple `N x i (where 1 <= i <= 10)` should be printed on a new line in the form: `N x i = result`.

## Input Format

A single integer, .

## Constraints

`2 <= N <= 20`
