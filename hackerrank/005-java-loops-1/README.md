## Objective 

In this challenge, we're going to use loops to help us do some simple math.

## Task

Given an integer,`N` , print its first `10` multiples. Each multiple `N * i (where 1 <= i <= 10)` should be printed on a new line in the form: `N * i = result`.

## Input Format

A single integer, .

## Constraints

`2 <= N <= 20`

## Output Format

Print 10 lines of output; each line `i(where where 1 <= i <= 10)` contains the  of `N * i` in the form: 
`N * i = result`.

## Sample Input

> 2
