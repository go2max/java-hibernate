## What is Java?

Learning to code is quickly becoming a requirement for any field of work. There is almost an infinite number of programming languages you can choose when learning to code and chances are you might have already tried some. In this course, we are going to be learning a programming language called "Java".

Java was written by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and has remained a popular and well-respected language for over 20 years. That is no small feat for a programming language. Despite being one of the older programming languages in use, Java remains one of the most popular for a variety of reasons:

- It's relatively easy to pick up
- It has great features for writing large and complex software solutions
- It has a ton of libraries with code ready for you to use
- There are plenty of resources for Java developers including books, courses, programs, and communities!

In this course, we choose to teach you Java because there are some very important aspects of writing code, and of the field of computer science, that Java does a really good job of handling. This gives us the opportunity to really dive into the most interesting conceptual ideas in building software solutions, and along the way, you will learn an industry standard language and method of writing code that is in high demand in the tech industry. These are some of the reasons many universities also use Java as their first programming language they ask students to learn.
